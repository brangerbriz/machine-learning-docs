## Features and Design Matrices

- What are features?
 	- Iris dataset
 	- Pixels in an image (mnist)
 	- Feature = Input

- Features are often hand chosen, especially in traditional machine learning pipelines. However there is much contemporary research that encourages against hand-selected features. Biases are introduced based on assumptions of what is (and is not) useful to the learning system. But results are often better if the human doesn't make the choice for the model, but rather the model decides for itself what is and is-not helpful to know about.
- Feature Learning

- Features should have low co-variance.
	- Use some co-variance matrices as an example
