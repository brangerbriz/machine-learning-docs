# Model Capacity

- [Capacity = The number of functions that a model can approximate](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/312424/what-is-the-capacity-of-a-machine-learning-model)
- The more model parameters the greater the capacity
- Capacity leads to overfitting :(
- Regularization can be used to reduce model capacity
