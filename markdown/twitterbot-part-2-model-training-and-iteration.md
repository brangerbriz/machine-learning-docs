# Twitterbot Part 2: Model Training and Iteration

In [Part 1](twitterbot-part-1-twitter-data-preperation.html) of this tutorial, we learned how to prepare twitter data for training. In this section, we'll learn how to use that data to train models. We'll begin with a basic introduction to model training as well as common training idioms, jargon, and practices. Then we'll learn how we can automate part of the training process using a technique called hyperparameter search to find a good model configuration, given our limited compute resources.
