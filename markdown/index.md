# Machine Learning

This document is a reference for all things Machine Learning at [Branger_Briz](http://brangerbriz.com). Since November 2016, our research team has been exploring the current state-of-the art in machine learning and this document serves as the product of much of that research. The goal of this resource is to provide a central repository for BB developers to learn about machine learning so that it can be used in current and future projects.

For a complete list of every web page included in this resource, see the [site index](site-index.html).

Over the past year, the BB R&&D lab has also created a small collection of ML related projects and case studies. You can explore what we've been up to on the [BB ML projects](bb-ml-projects.html) page. If you have questions about any of the content or practices that you find in this document, email <bdorsey@brangerbriz.com>. I've been doing lots of this research over the past few months and would love to answer questions or talk through how some of these ideas could be applied to your work.

In addition to these resources, I recommend checking out Google's awesome [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/), a free self-study course on the basics of ML. They've also compiled an [ML Glossary of terms](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/) that will be helpful to you as you try and make sense of data science jargon.
