# Machine Learning

This document is a reference for all things Machine Learning at [Branger_Briz](http://brangerbriz.com). Since November 2016<span class="marginal-note" data-info="We began with a [generative person-to-person video translation experiment](https://twitter.com/brannondorsey/status/808461108881268736) as well as an [introductory blog post](https://brangerbriz.com/blog/machine-learning-a-journey-towards-general-purpose-algorithms) on the subject of ML at large."></span>, our research team has been exploring the current state-of-the art in machine learning and this document serves as the product of much of that research. The goal of this resource is to provide a central repository for BB developers to learn about machine learning so that it can be used in current and future projects.

### Twitterbot Guide

An in-depth tutorial where we build an ML pipeline for generating your own twitter bots that sound like real twitter users. We'll show you how to use character embeddings, recurrent neural networks, hyperparameter search, and transfer learning, using Keras and Tensorflow.js. We recommend starting at [Part 1](twitterbot-part-1-twitter-data-preparation.html).

- Part 0: [Model Architecture](#)<span class="marginal-note" data-info="Part 0 gives a detailed breakdown of our model architecture. You can skip this section for now."></span>

## Other Resources

In addition to these resources, I recommend checking out Google's awesome [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/), a free self-study course on the basics of ML. They've also compiled an [ML Glossary of terms](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/) that will be helpful to you as you try and make sense of data science jargon.

Machine Learning Mastery's [blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/) also has hundreds of helpful short blog posts and code snippets on tons of topics in Machine Learning. I've found myself using several of those guides to learn about various topics in ML.
