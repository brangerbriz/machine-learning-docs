# Machine Learning

This document is a hypertext tutorial/reference manual for all things Machine Learning at Branger_Briz. Since November 2016, our R&&D team has been exploring the current state-of-the art in Machine Learning and this document serves as the product of much of that research. The goal of this resource is to provide a central repository for BB developers to learn about Machine Learning, so that it can be used in current and future projects.

The structure of this document is intentionally non-linear. There are, however, four main sections:

- [**Overview**](#overview): A fairly-linear overview of Machine Learning. Start here. 
- [**Tutorials**](#tutorials): Lots of code and examples. Here we dig deeper and learn to implement.
- [**Concepts & Details**](#): Explanations of more advanced ML topics. Fairly miscellanious.
- [**BB ML Projects**](#Branger_Briz-Machine-Learning-Projects): A collection of projects and experiments we've done using ML.

If you aren't particularly familiar with the fundamentals of Machine Learning, I would recommend reading through the [Overview](#overview) section in order. Otherwise, this document may be lightly perused or intensely dissected at will. Many of the links in the Overview and Tutorials sections link to further descriptions of ideas and pratices in the Concepts & Details section.

If you have questions about any of the content or practices that you find in this document, email <bdorsey@brangerbriz.com>. I've been doing lots of this research over the past few months and would love to answer questions or talk through how some of these ideas could be applied to your work.
