# Machine Learning

This document is a reference for all things Machine Learning at [Branger_Briz](http://brangerbriz.com). Since November 2016, our research team has been exploring the current state-of-the art in machine learning and this document serves as the product of much of that research. The goal of this resource is to provide a central repository for BB developers to learn about machine learning so that it can be used in current and future projects.

## Other Resources

In addition to these resources, I recommend checking out Google's awesome [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/), a free self-study course on the basics of ML. They've also compiled an [ML Glossary of terms](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/) that will be helpful to you as you try and make sense of data science jargon.
