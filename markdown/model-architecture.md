## Model Architecure

- Model capacity and overfitting
- Wide
	- easier to train
- Deep
	- much harder to train, but if you do it right it is known to generalize better
- Try a bunch of architectures and move towards the ones that work. Best results in deep learning are found emperically. This holds true for all kinds of things: activation functions, optimizers, etc...
