## Linear Regression

- The "Hello, World!" of machine learning
- Multi-deminsional space. If we express our data (any data) as real-valued multi-dimensional tensor vectors, we can perform geometry on it.
- Gradient descent and derivatives (links to 3Blue1Brown)
- ~~mention svms and decision trees~~
