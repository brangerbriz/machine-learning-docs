# Overfitting

- Model capacity is too large
- Model is memorizing the training data rather than learning to generalize
- Solution is regularization

# Underfitting

- The model is unable to learn patterns in the data
- Increase model capacity
- Get more data
- Change data representation (features/feature learning)
