## Data is ðŸ”‘

- Models can only be as good as the data that is used to train them. 
- The bottleneck in an ML pipeline is in access to high-quantities of high-quality data.
- The way you represent your data is as import, if not more important, than the raw data itself. 
	- Example
- Data quantities
	- When you are working w/ a machine learning system, it is often very helpful to think in orders-of-magnitude and exponentials instead of linearly. Twice as much data will likely not significantly increase your accuracy/performance, but 10x as much data probably will. (not sure if this is the right location for this. But this is a super helpful point that it took me a while to realize and internalize).
	- There are rules of thumb about how much data is enough, but the answer is always more data. A common solution to many problems in machine learning is "get more data".
- Training and test data (maybe mention validation split, or maybe hold that for a practical example later below)
