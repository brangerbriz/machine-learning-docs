## Guides & Examples

I've written and compiled collection of machine learning guides in the form of tutorials, ipython notebooks, and Tensorflow.js examples. 

- [Guides](guides.html)

The guides page includes descriptions and links to two repositories that hold example code:

- [ml-notebooks](https://github.com/brangerbriz/ml-notebooks): A collection of IPython notebooks
- [tf-electron](https://github.com/brangerbriz/tf-electron): A collection of Tensorflow.js examples wrapped in an Electron app

## Branger_Briz ML Projects

We've created a small collection of experiments and commercial projects using machine learning over the past two years.
