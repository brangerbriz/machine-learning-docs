## Evaluation and Tweaks

- Are you underfitting or overfitting?
- Adjust in orders of magnitude (value, value * 10, value * 100, etc) when you are trying to find the right value for something like a hyperparameter. You will cover ground more quickly.
- Only change one thing at a time between experiments. Changing more introduces ambiguity in what caused the results.
- [This blog post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/improve-deep-learning-performance/) has some good pointers for improving deep learning performance.
