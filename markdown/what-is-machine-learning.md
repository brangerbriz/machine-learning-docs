## What is machine learning?
	- For hard problems, don't write rules (heuristics), instead learn from data
	- Easier to do so as long as you have the data, and it generally works better
- What kind of problems is it good at solving? When and when not to use.
- What skills does it require?
	- Basic scripting skills, usually in python
	- General comfortability with:
		- Linear Algebra
		- Statistics
		- Probability   
		- I want to stress that these are more avenues of further research in order to improve your ml skillz. You don't have to be know much about them to get started.
- A brief history (so brief, like 1-2 paragraphs. Mainly to contextualize the current hype.)
	- Data explosion (big data)
	- GPGPU
	- Previous AI winters (beware the hype)
