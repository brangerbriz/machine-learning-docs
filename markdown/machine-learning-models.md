## Models

- A model is a synthetic representation of the way something in the real world works.
	- There is a function that describes everything non-random. Knowing this true real-world function is impossible without knowing every example of it (past and future). But extimating/approximating these functions can be done if you have enough examples of the function. The extimation function is called a model.
- Model vs architecure
- Models are:
    - Trained/learned.
    - The product of machine learning.
    - The algorithm.
    - Function approximators.
- Difference between training a model and using it in production (testing)
