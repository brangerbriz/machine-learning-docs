## Types of learning: Supervised vs Unsupervised

- Supervised:
	- Labeled data.
    - Easiest to learn from.
    - Scarce.
    - Expensive (often, but not always).
    - Classic machine learning. We've been doing this well for decades. But now we are doing it REALLY well.

- Unsupervised:
    - Unlabeled data.
    - Abundant.
	- Cheap.
	- Surprising.
	- Advancements in unsupervised learning are hot right now.
	- learning have potential to make the most impact.
	- GANs as example
