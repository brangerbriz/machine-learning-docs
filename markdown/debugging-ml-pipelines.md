## Troubleshooting/debugging ML pipelines

- Debugging an ML pipeline is harder than traditional software debugging because there are more places the problem could lie. First try to identify if the problem is:
	- With the data, or data representation
	- In your code implementation (error in your python logic for instance)
	- A flaw in your model architecture or graph
