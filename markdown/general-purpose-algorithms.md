## General Purpose Algorithms
- Machine learning techniques are general purpose. The same ML architecture/algorithm can be used to:
	- General
		- Pattern recognition of all types (DLB p. 97)
		- Classification
		- Classification w/ missing inputs
		- Regression
		- Transcription
		- Machine Translation
		- ~~Structured Output~~
		- Anomaly detection
		- Synthesis and sampling
		- ~~Imputation of missing values~~
		- Denoising
		- ~~Density / probability mass function estimation~~
	- Specific
	 	- Filter your email spam.
	 	- Predict your liability for an insurance company.
		- Write new content in the style of a dead author.
		- Sell you sh*t on the internet.
		- Generate millions of new songs.
		- Predict stock prices.
		- Produce spam email.
		- Predict the effects of global warming.
		- Provide an “understanding” of an environment than can be used to drive an autonomous vehicle.

- Universal function approximators (what an insanely powerful idea)
- Has the potential to be as big as general purpose computers
