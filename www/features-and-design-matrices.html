<li><p>Features are often hand chosen, especially in traditional machine learning pipelines. However there is much contemporary research that encourages against hand-selected features. Biases are introduced based on assumptions of what is (and is not) useful to the learning system. But results are often better if the human doesn&#39;t make the choice for the model, but rather the model decides for itself what is and is-not helpful to know about.</p>
