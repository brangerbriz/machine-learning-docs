<h1 id="cross-validation">Cross Validation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Used to evaluate w/ &quot;test&quot; data during training, so that you have a comparible loss measure between training and test data to know when divergence begins so you can early-stop.</li>
<li>From wikipedia: The goal of cross validation is to define a dataset to &quot;test&quot; the model in the training phase (i.e., the validation dataset), in order to limit problems like overfitting, give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem), etc.</li>
