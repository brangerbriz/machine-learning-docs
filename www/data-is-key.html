<ul>
<li>Models can only be as good as the data that is used to train them. </li>
<li>The bottleneck in an ML pipeline is in access to high-quantities of high-quality data.</li>
<li>The way you represent your data is as import, if not more important, than the raw data itself. <ul>
<li>Example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data quantities<ul>
<li>When you are working w/ a machine learning system, it is often very helpful to think in orders-of-magnitude and exponentials instead of linearly. Twice as much data will likely not significantly increase your accuracy/performance, but 10x as much data probably will. (not sure if this is the right location for this. But this is a super helpful point that it took me a while to realize and internalize).</li>
<li>There are rules of thumb about how much data is enough, but the answer is always more data. A common solution to many problems in machine learning is &quot;get more data&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<li>Training and test data (maybe mention validation split, or maybe hold that for a practical example later below)</li>
