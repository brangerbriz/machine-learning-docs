<h1 id="probability-distributions">Probability Distributions</h1>
<p>A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of a set of possible occurrences taking place. By randomly drawing samples from a distribution, called <em>sampling</em>, we can expect our random selections to match the true distribution of the data as our number of samples approaches infinity (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a>).</p>
<p>You can think of a probability distribution as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">histogram</a>. A histogram features an ordered list of occurrences on the x-axis (called the domain) and the number of times those occurrences are present in some experiment as the y-axis (called the range). Below is an example of a measuring the pedal length feature from the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set">Iris dataset</a>. </p>

<h2 id="common-distribution-types">Common Distribution Types</h2>
<p>Many probability distributions fall into a few categories of distribution types. These are not one-size-fits-all categories and not all distributions will clearly belong to these archetypes, but they can be helpful in understanding how your data is distributed. </p>
<h3 id="symmetric-gaussian-distribution">Symmetric Gaussian Distribution</h3>
<p><img src="images/histogram-symmetric.png" alt="Histogram"></p>
<p>This is one of the most common (and famous) <a href="discrete-vs-continuous-data.html">continuous</a> distribution types, called the <em>normal</em> or <em>Guassian</em> distribution (informally the <em>bell curve</em>). It appears all over the place in nature. For this reason it is &quot;often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<pre><code>GAUSSIAN CODE EXAMPLE HERE
</code></pre><h4 id="gaussian-distributions-and-the-central-limit-theorem">Gaussian Distributions and The Central Limit Theorem</h4>
<p>The Guassian distribution is particularly helpful because when the number of observations is particularly large, it is often the case that averages of samples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory">independent random variables</a>) independently drawn from different distributions converge to a distribution that is <em>normal</em>, even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. This phenomenon is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a>, and it is particularly important because it &quot;implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.&quot; (the frequency of the average of a non-normal distribution is commonly normal)</p>
<p>As your sample size from an arbitrary distribution becomes larger, the frequency distribution of that sampling becomes more normally distributed. Taking 10,000 samples of sample size four will have a an equal mean, but a larger variance than if you were to use a sample size of 10. As sample size increases the distribution of your sampling converges at a normal distribution. </p>
<p>If we add a bunch of samples of any real-world occurrence with an unknown non-normal distribution, average each sample together, and plot their frequency (real-value or index as domain, frequency as range) the resulting distribution will approach normal as our sample size increases. Therefore, the normal distribution is a great approximation of the mean of a lot of processes.</p>
<p>The resulting distribution is called the *Sampling Distribution of the sample mean.&quot; The mean of the Sampling Distribution will be the same as the mean of the distribution being sampled.</p>
<p>There is not one perfect normal distribution. There are infinitely many, each with their own average and std dev.</p>
<p>skew = measure of asymmetry<br>kurtosis = tailedness (longer tail = more kurtosis)</p>
<p>The smaller the magnitude of skew and kurtosis the more normal a distribution is.</p>
