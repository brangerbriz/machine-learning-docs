<p>This document is a hypertext tutorial/reference manual for all things Machine Learning at <a href="http://brangerbriz.com">Branger_Briz</a>. Since November 2016, our R&amp;&amp;D team has been exploring the current state-of-the art in machine learning and this document serves as the product of much of that research. The goal of this resource is to provide a central repository for BB developers to learn about machine learning so that it can be used in current and future projects.</p>
<p>The structure of this document is intentionally non-linear. The first layer of content provides an overview of machine learning at large. In each page you will find hyperlinks that dig deeper into concepts and details. The deeper you go, the more specific the information becomes.</p>

<p>Over the past year, the BB R&amp;&amp;D lab has also created a small collection of ML related projects and case studies. You can explore what we&#39;ve been up to on the <a href="bb-ml-projects.html">BB ML projects</a> page. If you have questions about any of the content or practices that you find in this document, email <a href="mailto:&#x62;&#x64;&#x6f;&#114;&#115;&#101;&#x79;&#x40;&#x62;&#x72;&#97;&#110;&#x67;&#x65;&#x72;&#98;&#114;&#105;&#122;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#x62;&#x64;&#x6f;&#114;&#115;&#101;&#x79;&#x40;&#x62;&#x72;&#97;&#110;&#x67;&#x65;&#x72;&#98;&#114;&#105;&#122;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a>. I&#39;ve been doing lots of this research over the past few months and would love to answer questions or talk through how some of these ideas could be applied to your work.</p>
