<ul>
<li>Keeping track of your experiments and model iterations is <strong>super important</strong>! Most of the code written for an ML pipeline is actually about managing your experiments in a way where you stay sane. </li>
<li>Keep each experiment (trained model) in a separate place, and save all of the information you need to reproduce the experiment alongside it (notes, hyperparameter values, etc.) I usually have an <code>experiments/</code> folder that contains files like this:<ul>
<li><code>experiment_1/</code><ul>
<li><code>hyperparameters.json</code></li>
<li><code>checkpoints/</code> (saved model weight checkpoints go in here)</li>
<li><code>notes.txt</code> (general notes and comments about this experiment)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="https://andrewhalterman.com/2018/03/05/managing-machine-learning-experiments/">blog post</a> of a similar approach by Andy Halterman.</li>
