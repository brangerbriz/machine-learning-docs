<pre><code>- For hard problems, don&#39;t write rules (heuristics), instead learn from data
- Easier to do so as long as you have the data, and it generally works better
</code></pre><ul>
<li>What kind of problems is it good at solving? When and when not to use.</li>
<li>What skills does it require?<ul>
<li>Basic scripting skills, usually in python</li>
<li>General comfortability with:<ul>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Probability   </li>
<li>I want to stress that these are more avenues of further research in order to improve your ml skillz. You don&#39;t have to be know much about them to get started.</li>
</ul>
