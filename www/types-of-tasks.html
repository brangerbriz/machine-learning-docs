<p>Before we continue, I want to hammer in the difference between two of the most common ML tasks <a href="general-purpose-algorithms.html#classification">we mentioned before</a>.</p>

<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations whose category membership is known. (wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Classification problems output a probability distribution over a set of categories (e.g. 22% probability an email is spam, 88% probability an email is legitimate). The probability distribution produced by a classification problem sums to <code>1.0</code>, <code>0.22 + 0.88 = 1.0</code>.</p>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<p>Regression problems produce real-valued floats, or rather, a probability mass distribution over real-valued continuous floats that integrate to <code>1.0</code>.</p>
